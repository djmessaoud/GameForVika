# GameForVika
2D Game in Unity made for wife's birthday of Viktoria


<b> The game:
</b>

Birdie (the little girl) starting her path from a cold place (Russia) and has to go through obstacles (Society's judgment, her father's alcoholism, ...) in her journey and adapt to these obstacles (dodge) using the power of music.

<h2> Gameplay: </h2>

<b> 1- Move Vika (Birdy) to dodge the obstacles coming at her 

2- While moving, a song is played, and the first letter of the song's name is written above in red. 

3- While dodging obstacles, write the letter as well so that the next letter of the name is shown
After writing all the letters from the song's name, a new song will be played with a different name.

4- The score increases after tapping each correct letter of the song's name and decreases after each obstacle hits vika and slows her down a little bit.

</ul>
Then, after some point of maturity, she gets into a place where she has to say a word that will open to her the heart of the Lion (Lion King) which she was dreaming about since her childhood. 

After saying the word "Existential crisis", the path to the Lion's heart will be opened.

<hr> Then, she gets to meet the Lion in warmth and nature! (From cold, to warmth.) 

<hr> <b> In the end, a letter will be shown in the end from the Lion to birdy (written letter by letter with beautiful sound of keyboard that can be muted as well) :) 

Game rules are shown in the Game!
